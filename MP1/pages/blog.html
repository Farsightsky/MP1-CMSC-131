        <p>I have seen creatures, great and small, but no one beats this little furball. I met this little ball of joy after I departed from the planet Iota Geminorum IV. I was there to collect data from its planetary wildlife. Anyways, it started jumping.
        </p><p>It seemed that it likes me. I do not exactly know its gender. I’m going to call it an ‘it’. The gender is very indeterminable at first sight. Oof! Eureka. I extracted its DNA, and it says that it’s a giant sentient cell.
        </p><p>"Squeak!” oh my I think I might have stepped on it. Interesting…
        </p><p>The creature is so flexible. What does this eat though? Is it carnivorous, herbivores? Maybe it is not picky. At the moment, I am indecisive about whether I should adopt it or not.  Nothing ever comes out good on adopting a new type of species when you are in an intersystem journey. Hmmm, after a long self-deliberation, I decided to keep it.
        </p><p>After my impulsive and illogical, it began to eat my stuff. I never reakized that it was such a glutton. Fortunately, I don’t have to think about the food rations since I locked the storage space.
        </p><p>With my own eyes, I see this goopy furball multiply. Now, that is a real problem. I need to become isolate this pandemonium before it gets worse. Welp, it turned into four now.
        </p><p>After an hour, it destroyed the kitchen. I was able to shoot the sixteen Tribbles with the cryostasis gun. Don’t fret. They are still alive, only literally frozen in time since they were gunned in ice. Welp, I guess I have to modify their genes so they won’t be able to multiply that often, and perhaps I should tune their consumption rate so that they won't be that annoying when I unfreeze them.
        </p><p>I guess the Tribbles aren't causing any troubles anymore.

        <p> Have you ever seen a black hole? Me neither. Logically, it is impossible to see a black hole since it sucks everything, even light, which is the primary source of visual imagery. Looking at it, you can only see the bending lights around it. Good thing the ship has detected a massive gravitational pull around 2 light-years away. Suddenly…
        </p><p>“Warning! Massive gravitational interference 9 light-years ahead”, the mainframe warned.
        </p><p>This is not great.
        </p><p>“Warning! Massive gravitational interference 1   light-year ahead”, the mainframe responded.
        </p><p>Something’s off.
        </p><p>“Heading to the Bootes Void”, the mainframe added.
        </p><p>Yep, the spaceship’s broken. I am alone. This is not a good time to panic… It’s a great time to panic.
        </p><p>“Don’t panic, a breach has been detected. Oxygen levels are down. Go to the nearest evacuation pod”, this is not safe anymore.
        </p><p>Kablam! Boom! The nuclear fission reactor failed. Lights were out. The escape pods are inoperable.
        </p><p>This has to be a…
        </p><p>“Simulation over. The stress test has concluded”, the mainframe announced. 
        </p><p>I woke up.
        </p><p>Why did I build this to project stressors during sleep? I don’t know. Perhaps, it is my disdain to myself for being alone. It’s a good thing that I have 16 tribbles as a company. They behave significantly better after the genetic modification. Although they are still nibbling everything they could find. I think that is for show and cuteness.
        </p><p>Oh, how I miss company. I got up and look by the window, and I see this magnificent space, twinkling while being calm.I also saw this picturesque black hole light-years away. Oh no.
        </p><p>I immediately went to the pilot room to navigate the ship. "I'm not panicking", I said to myself while being in self-denial.
