        <p>Luna was a property of mine, but I often left it unscathed. I have never set afoot there. I bought it with the spare cash that I gathered on my lucky streak on a space casino during my journey to the center of the galaxy. The satellite was sort of an investment. Space property is really hard to come by these days. Luna is currently orbiting Kepler-452a.
        </p><p>The satellite is still terraformed by the contractors that I have hired. They are like this diverse intersystem company. They have all sorts of employees from the sapient flying lizards who are usually transporting goods due to their overall speed, sentient robots who do their logistics, igneous rock golems who do the heavy works, and a lot of species that I could not specify, like that one giant green blob who can disintegrate ingested matter and produce oxygen as a byproduct.
        </p><p>Honestly, I was sort of in a split here whether to keep Luna or sell it at a higher price. Maybe I should rethink the evaluation of whether I could rent to someone so that I could have a sort of passive income. Of course, it would be only useful if I could be paid with a universal currency, but I doubt it since the only people that can afford to do that are the nobles among the galactic empire, the socialites on certain planets that dominate the galactic market, or the legionnaires from the galactic rebellion. Yet, I am pretty confident that one of them might reconsider renting or even buying Luna. Renting is much preferable for me though, so that I can still have the ownership of Luna.
        </p><p>For now, I would like to savor every moment I could on this travel while collecting DNA samples from being all across the universe. Coming across life is very rare. Sentient life is even rarer.
        </p><p>I have to take care of the Tribbles again. I must go to make pet food. I apologize for my retro-tech camera.

        <p>Yup, that is me. I hate being in pictures, but it is necessary since the view is phenomenal.
        </p><p>I was on a space cruise ship before hyperdrive. This was taken a long time ago before I had my ship. Most of the passengers are humanoid, including me. It was sort of a vacation. I went on this arranged round trip to visit galactic landmarks. I was on the observatory deck of the ship.
        </p><p>I remembered this scene when I met a girl, and she noticed that I got a camera.
        </p><p>“Are you a photographer?” she curiously asked.
        </p><p>“Ah, no”, I anxiously replied, “It’s just an unusual hobby to carry around a camera.”
        </p><p>“Would you mind?”, she took my camera while I mindlessly explain myself to her.
        </p><p>“This would be better if you smile”, she smiled.
        </p><p>Her face was so bright that I was infected by her cheerful appearance. This is nice. I never felt that before with a stranger. My heartbeat felt a bit weird. My throat sored. My face went red.
        </p><p>“Are you ok?”, she returned my camera.
        </p><p>“Ah, yes, uh…”, I looked at a picture, “Thank you for this, wow! You’re an artist.”
        </p><p>After that, we shared moments of good laughs during our flight. As it turns out, we have a lot of things in common.  She was also a traveler. We both like cheese, but we don’t like it too fermented since it makes our tummy squeezy.
        </p><p>We never met again after that flight. She must have forgotten me, but I have not. Thanks to this picture, taken via an ancient polaroid.
